Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from to for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet .

Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing with , with , and with .

    If , then Alice is awarded point.
    If , then Bob is awarded point.
    If , then neither person receives a point.

Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given and , can you compare the two challenges and print their respective comparison points?

Input Format

The first line contains space-separated integers, , , and , describing the respective values in triplet .
The second line contains space-separated integers, , , and , describing the respective values in triplet .

Constraints

Output Format

Print two space-separated integers denoting the respective comparison points earned by Alice and Bob

Solution:

#!/bin/python
import sys
a0,a1,a2 = raw_input().strip().split(' ')
a= [int(a0),int(a1),int(a2)]
b0,b1,b2 = raw_input().strip().split(' ')
b = [int(b0),int(b1),int(b2)]
s=map(lambda x,y:1 if x>y else 2 if x==y else 0 ,a,b)
print s.count(1),s.count(0)
